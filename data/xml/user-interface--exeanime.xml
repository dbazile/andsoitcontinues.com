    A design for an anime-themed website that never launched. The
    site owner was a friend of mine (i.e., broke teenager without
    the means to pay).

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      This site and its name were heavily inspired by <a target="_blank"
      href="http://megaman.wikia.com/wiki/Mega_Man_Battle_Network_(series)">Mega
      Man Battle Network series</a>, which around the time my friend pitched the
      site to me was blowing up in popularity online.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time, I was learning about advanced CSS 2.0 techniques.
