    A design I threw together for a friend's fan-fiction website.

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      For those not in the know, <a target="_blank"
      href="http://sonic.wikia.com/wiki/Hidden_Palace_Zone_(Sonic_the_Hedgehog_2)"><em>Hidden
      Palace Zone</em></a> is the name of a stage from the <a target="_blank"
      href="http://sonic.wikia.com/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_series">Sonic the
      Hedgehog</a> series. It also happened to be the name my friend decided on
      for his fanfic repository.
    </p>

      The &ldquo;chaos gems&rdquo; in the background were actually the
      result of a completely serendipitous mistake I made in a 3d
      modeling program I was messing with at the time. I just adjusted
      the HSB values for each in Photoshop, then stuck em in the
      background.

      I committed my biggest web development atrocity on this
      project&mdash;using Flash for the navigation items. The nav made a
      little <em>bleep</em> sound when you clicked on one of the elements. This,
      of course, does not fall back to anything in the event Flash
      isn't installed, and the list of URLs is hardcoded into the .SWF
      file. In my defense, I was 16 and Progressive Enhancement
      wouldn't pop up on anyone's radar until a few years after I
      delivered this.
