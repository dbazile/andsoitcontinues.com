    A modest-sized PC gamers' guild community website I made for a friend.

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      Implemented with limited CSS knowledge and the ubiquitous table-based
      layout, getting that goon's arm to properly float off the main body made
      this relatively simple design a big pain.  Looking at this code to package
      it up makes me cringe. I'm still trying to figure out how I made this work
      all those years ago.

    <p>
      This gamers' group was centered on the <a target="_blank"
      href="http://tribes.wikia.com/wiki/Tribes_Wiki">Tribes</a> series.  I
      don't know much about any of the games as I never played any of them but
      this was made as a favor for a friend.

    <h4>What the heck is d3fect studios?</h4>
    <p>
      In case you're wondering, <strong>d3fect studios</strong> was my design
      <em>nom de plume</em> back then, .com and everything!  Of course, with
      the clientele being what it was (i.e., broke teenagers without the means
      to pay), I never charged anything and it went nowhere.  Oddly enough, a
      squatter picked it the domain name within days after I let it expire...
