  <narrative>
    <p>
      I got my start in web design building web pages for the various
      fan-fiction writers, sketch/sprite artists, community forum
      moderators, and the many other various creatives of the Mega Man
      fan club Internet community. This is one of the last projects I
      did for my old crew before I joined the military.
