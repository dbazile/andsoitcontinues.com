    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      I got my start in web design/development building web pages for the myriad
      creative types of the online Mega Man fan community: fan-fiction authors,
      sprite artists, illustrators, self-appointed anime/game news
      correspondents, community forum moderators, etc.  This is one of the last
      projects I did for my old crew before I joined the military.

    <p>
      Unfortunately, all I've got left from this project is just the mockup as I
      don't believe I ever properly backed-up the prototype.
