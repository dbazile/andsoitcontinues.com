    A promotion page for an ambitious game mod development project based on
    Return to Castle Wolfensten.

  <narrative>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      This mod was based on the PC-based first-person-shooter <a target="_blank"
      href="http://wolfenstein.wikia.com/wiki/Return_to_Castle_Wolfenstein">Return
      to Castle Wolfenstein</a>.  The team was attempting to use the RTCW engine
      to write a campaign mission storyline.  The goal here was replacing the
      HTML 3.0 monstrosity that was their original site to help build hype for
      the mod.
    </p>
    <h4>So what happened?</h4>
    <p>
      I'm pretty sure this project ended up being vaporware and was never
      released.
