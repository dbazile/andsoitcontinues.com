    A modest-sized PC gamers' guild website used for scheduling scrimmage
    sessions and tournaments, hosting player-generated media and
    community-building.

  <narrative>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      I made this design for a <a target="_blank"
      href="http://wolfenstein.wikia.com/wiki/Return_to_Castle_Wolfenstein">Return
      to Castle Wolfenstein</a> gamers' group I was a member of. This was a
      pretty straightforward layout with a minimal amount of PHP for server-side
      includes for itemizing directories of thumbnails and screenshots.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bumped into these guys back when I was averaging about 15 hours
      a week of RTCW. I'd hang out on their server because it was always
      well-coordinated, organized and people actually contributed to the
      match instead of just running around aimlessly. Impressed by my mad
      medic skills and because I was there all the time anyway, they
      asked me to join up. After I went to their website to register, I
      saw what they had up there and offered to spiff it up for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe they went live with the redesign shortly after delivery.
