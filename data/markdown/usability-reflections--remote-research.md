    This week's assignment was to evaluate two online remote research
    providers, determine the pros and cons and state which of the two
    we might be inclined to use and why.

*Disclaimer: Although I did include my personal choice as to which service I'd use in my assignment submission, I've omitted that here since I don't know that an arm-chair assessment of either of the companies' services is fair.  I've just listed the apparent pros and cons based on my brief observations.*

## The Contenders

### [ethnio](http://ethn.io)

Ethnio has a well-defined and well-communicated product offering, shows you exactly what you get and what the user will see, and all around does a fantastic job of marketing their services.

#### Pros

* Site design **has personality and quickly communicates the purpose** of the company
* **Explicitly mentions** ***"recruiting usability test participants"*** as one of the company's offerings
* Landing page **shows what both you and the users get**, i.e., owner's dashboard and "would you like to participate" request screenshots
* Selection pool consists of **your actual customers**

#### Cons

* **Fixed monthly cost** means that you're paying a set amount each month (there are usage tiers depending on page views)
* Interrupting workflows **might annoy some visitors**

#### Bonus Points

Digging around on their website, I found a super-clever use of CSS to make a scalable curly brace representation:

### [Amazon Mechanical Turk](http://www.mturk.com)

From what I could glean from the site, Mechanical Turk<sup>1</sup> effectively operates as a human work load-balancer&mdash;feed work in one end and it distributes it across an *N*-node human worker network.

#### Pros

* **Name recognition** via *Amazon* branding
* Similar cost model to AWS means it's **likely a more cost-effective solution**
* Since it's designed as a human PaaS<sup>2</sup>, **you can BYOT&mdash;Bring Your Own Test**
* **Active selection by participants** means potentially quicker filling of slots

#### Cons

* Relatively spartan design is unfocused and **does not quickly communicate its purpose**
* Their **members may not be representative** of your target users
