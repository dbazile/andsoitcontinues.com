Subject:  Interaction Design Reflections: Interactive Prototypes
Tags:     interaction design, ux, school, coursework
Abstract: This week involved building out a fully-interactive prototype of the project mobile app, showing off our designed user journeys and planned interactions.

## Full disclosure: I actually finished this assignment last weekend

This is what I spent last weekend doing (and incidentally how I got more familiar with proto.io)&mdash;<strike>[gold-plating](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GoldPlating)</strike>, err, _crafting_ the entire interactive wireframe.  Which is probably a good thing, considering the hair-fire mid-sprint demo dropped on me at work this week.

## The Takeaway

### Phrase of the day: `glaring oversight`

Stepped into this week feeling pretty confident about that prototype.  Thankfully, I was humbled rather quickly by: (a) one of my classmates prototype being much prettier than mine; and (b) someone pointing out several missing screens, such as the ability to list "favorited" meals and details around the __Auto-refill__ mechanisms.

### I always feel weird critiquing other's work

As if _I_ know what _I'm_ talking about, ha.  Plus, I know how defensive I can be about my own work, so I try to keep that in mind before I go poking holes in the work of others.  Sometimes I wonder if that makes me hold back on criticism if I feel there may be too much to complain about.

It's also weird because the critiquing for this assignment may appear retaliatory (feedback is async; you can view someone's feedback before giving your own).  It kinda makes me hold back a bit more if I'm reviewing someone who dinged me on some things, lest it look as if I'm trying to get even.
