I was a long-time Apple Music customer since back when I first started
using Macs for work.  My current employer doesn't offer that though so
when I left my last company, I had to switch to Spotify.

Spotify was decent for the most part.  I loved their music discovery
model.  Their UI design has always been dubious but I eventually got
past it since the service itself was rock solid **and** they have a
"native" (read, Electron) client available for Linux that responds to
keyboard media keys.

Then they went and made [a change that completely broke by
workflow](https://community.spotify.com/t5/iOS-iPhone-iPad/Album-view-doesn-t-filter-out-unsaved-songs/m-p/4734047#M111940)
so I switched back to Apple Music and used [Musish](https://musi.sh)
in my browser.

Musish gets the job done but some expected features don't work (not
the Musish developers' fault as there are _gaping_ functionality holes
in the MusicKitJS API).


## So, how is the official Apple Music web experience?

Streaming can be spotty with some songs failing to fully buffer and
the API not retrying the fetch (the same issue affected Musish) but
it is a beta after all.  Eventually the kinks will be ironed out and
I'll be returned to seamless Apple Music listening bliss that works
properly on my phone and desktop.

It's good to be home again. :)
