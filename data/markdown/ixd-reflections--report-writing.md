## The Takeaway

I'll spare you the text since it's largely a rollup of other things I've mentioned in previous posts in this series along with a hefty amount of literary fluff.

The objective of this particular assignment was to evaluate our ability to articulate design decisions, challenges and outcomes of a project.  The prescribed format for organizing the report was _PARL_.

### What is _PARL_?

* __Problem__: What design challenge were you asked to solve?
* __Action__: What was the plan to address this?
* __Results__: What was the outcome of your actions?
* __Lessons Learned__: What did you learn about the domain, research, design and/or yourself?
