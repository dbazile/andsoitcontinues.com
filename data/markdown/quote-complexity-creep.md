Complexity creep is something that should be fought tooth and nail where ever you find it. It's the biggest enemy of keeping your code maintainable. __As soon as you feel that you're losing track of what is going on you need to step back and re-think your approach and re-factor.__ If you don't then in the long term you'll lose control completely. It's not a matter of &lsquo;if' but &lsquo;when' and by the time &lsquo;when' rolls around you will end up wishing you had taken care of the problem when it was still tractable. Short term thinking on long term projects is not an option.
