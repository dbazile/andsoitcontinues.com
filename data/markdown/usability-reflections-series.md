Abstract: A multi-part series documenting what I'm learning about usability.  Contains a moderate amount of sophomoric conjecture, logical gymnastics and the occasional soapbox rant.

I'm currently working towards a masters degree in User Experience Design.  I'm taking Usability I this semester, which asks students to keep a "reflection journal" in blog format.

We were given the option of making a private blog for the express purpose of this requirement, or making a public one.  Considering that I've already got a public blog that rarely sees posts, I figured why not.
