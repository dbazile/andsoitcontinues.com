    Public Service Announcement: Check your spam folder for YouTube
    notifications if you have Gmail forwarding your mail to another
    account.

For the last few weeks, I haven't seen a single YouTube notification
from any of the accounts I subscribe to.  So this morning, I logged
into Gmail and sure enough, everything from YouTube since 10/31 got
automatically flagged as spam.

I'll reserve judgement for whatever the reason was for this...
oversight.  Is oversight the right word? ðŸ¤”
