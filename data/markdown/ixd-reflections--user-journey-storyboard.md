## Storyboards as a User Journey communication tool

A User Journey is a way to tell a story from beginning to end for some goal a user has with relation to an application.  The key to using a Storyboard to do this is showing progression with _some_ degree of context and indicate subject's emotion along the way.

## The Takeaway

### Challenges

Deliberate storyboarding is completely new to me, so naturally I ran into a few challenges:

#### Not enough time to build proficiency with [proto.io](https://proto.io)

So I've been ultra-busy at work in recent weeks cleaning up some technical debt (that I'm entirely responsible for) __and__ not fall too far behind sprint commitments.  I didn't get a chance to look at the assignment list until Friday night.

> Behold, [a new thing to learn](https://proto.io)!

It's probably my fault for trying to run the thing in Safari, but its interactions take some getting used to.  After fighting with the canvas for about fifteen minutes to build a single screen, I realized how much time I was losing and fired up Sketch.


#### Staying on target was challenging

I did a wireframing exercise last week for an app I'm working on which moved sequentially through a series of very high-level workflows.  Kind of a storyboard minus the explicit narrative.

Had a tough time trying to keep that mindset from bleeding into this work.  At each step, I had to ask myself:

> Self?  Does this particular element actually contribute to the
> narrative or is it superfluous?

<!>

> Hi Self, me again.  Is someone who doesn't know the app going to
> have any clue how they got from the last frame to this one?

Still not convinced that I did it exactly right.  Guess I'll find out when the grade comes back!
