## "drive-by" UI

A class of user interfaces written by developers who look down on frontend
developers because "UI is easy".  These developers build spectacularly brittle
UIs in a short amount of time, then move on to whatever other activity they
deem worthy of their skills, leaving chaos and destruction in their wake.

These hastily-built UIs underperform and blow up regularly, after which they
usually become the responsibility of _actual_ frontend developers to extend.
