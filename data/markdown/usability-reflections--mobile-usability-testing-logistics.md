Abstract: This week, we wrote a proposal to customize a usability lab for mobile usability testing.

## Credit where it's due

I got a lot of great practical information from [this talk by MailChimp's Jenn Downs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpgSKsV9hm0).


## The Takeaway

### Plenty of opportunity for Minimalism

What I found pretty interesting part about this kind of testing is just how zen you can get with it.  You can essentially do this literally anywhere with just two cameras and a laptop.  If you don't care about the user's facial expressions, you can even get by with just one camera.  The most complicated thing about my proposed setup is screencasting the simultaneous recordings.  The "shopping list" (excluding the mobile devices, of course) could all be had on Amazon for ~$150, most assuredly less if you shop around.
