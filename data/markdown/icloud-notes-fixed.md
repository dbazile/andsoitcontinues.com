    No more copy/paste from Sublime into iCloud.com's Notes app.

To the [iCloud.com](https://www.icloud.com) engineer(s) who fixed Notes'
frustrating mapping of the Home and End keys from jumping the cursor
to the top/bottom of the whole document instead of the beginning/end of
the current line (as one would expect):

![THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU](/public/writing/attachments/thank_you.jpg)

I use iCloud.com daily and this one change, though seemingly small, has
made my life easier.
