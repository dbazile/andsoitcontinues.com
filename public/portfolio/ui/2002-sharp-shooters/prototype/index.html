              Yesterday night we managed, for the first time, to have three clan

              members in the same server. Needless to say that we ruled the server

              completely. The screenshots will prove it. (A little bit of pride

              never hurted anyone :)). Hope to play with all clan members from

              now on. Go to Konijn (EURO) and watch us in action.</p>

              The matches' schedule will be sent to all of you as soon as it becomes

              available for the public. Every clan member must be registered in

              War Zone. To all non- portuguese clan members, we will register

              you with our emails and all information will be translated and sent

              to you. Do not, I repeat, do not register in War Zone because there

              can be conflicts with our registration and portuguese is an hard

              to observe them a little bit more. We would apreciate clan members

              to comunicate us the servers they usualy play on so we could observe

              and play with them. Another important new: We have joined a tournament,

              BarrysWorld RTCW League, we don't know yet if and when we are going

              to play but we must get prepared, we need at least five players

              and a maximum of six. Go there and check it out. I'll keep you all
